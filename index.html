                                 however, it is possible to run X Series PRO and Metatrader 4 by
                                 using a Windows emulator on a Mac [such as Metatrader for Mac]. We strongly
                                 recommend using X Series PRO on Windows PCs for best results. X Series PRO
                                 will NOT work on mobile devices such as phones or tablets as these versions of
                                 Metatrader 4 do not allow complex plugins.

                              <p>Metatrader 4 is a great trading platform, but the trading process leaves much to be
                                 desired. Placing trades in MT4 is inefficient, lacks intuitive
                                 "on the charts" trading and is just plain slow. X Series PRO simplifies the trade
                                 process so you can take control of your trading. X Series PRO is
                                 powerful. It utilizes strong money management, automates position sizing
                                 calculations and monitors/manages your trades so you don't have to.

               Quantix Solutions may also collect and use non-personally identifiable
               information (Non-PII). Non-PII is information that cannot be used to
               identify a particular individual. For example, Quantix Solutions will
               collect statistical data, such as the numbers of visits to its website. We
               collect this data to understand how users use our websites, products, and
               services so that we can improve our services and better satisfy your needs.
               Quantix Solutions may collect, use, process, transfer, or disclose non-PII
               for other purposes at its own discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
               We will endeavor to isolate your personal data from non-PII and ensure that
               the two types of data are used separately. If personal data is combined
               with non-PII, it will still be treated as personal data during processing.

               To ensure our website works correctly, we may at times place a small piece
               of data known as a cookie on your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a
               text file stored by a web server on a computer or mobile device. The
               content of a cookie can be retrieved or read only by the server that
               creates the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of identifiers,
               site names, and some numbers and characters. Cookies are unique to the
               browsers or mobile applications you use and enable websites to store data
               such as your preferences or items in your shopping cart.

               Like many other websites or Internet service providers, Quantix Solutions
               uses cookies to improve user experience. Session cookies are deleted after
               each visit, while persistent cookies remain in place across multiple
               visits. Cookies allow websites to remember your settings such as language,
               font size on your computer or mobile device, or other browser preferences.
               This means that a user does not need to reset preferences for every visit.
               On the contrary, if cookies are not used, websites will treat you as a new
               visitor every time you load a web page. For example, if you are redirected
               to another web page from a website you are already logged in to and then
               return to the original website, it will not recognize you and you must log
               in again.

               2.2 Web Beacons and Pixel Tags
            </p>
            <p>
               In addition to cookies, we may also use other similar technologies on our
               websites such as web beacons and pixel tags. For example, when you receive
               an email from Quantix Solutions, it may contain a click-through URL that
               links to a Quantix Solutions web page. If you click the link, Quantix
               Solutions will track your visit to help us learn about your preferences for
               products and services and improve our customer service. A web beacon is a
               transparent graphic image embedded in a website or in an email. We use
               pixel tags in emails to find out whether an email has been opened. You can
               unsubscribe from the Quantix Solutions mailing list at any time if you do
               not want to be tracked in this manner.

               By using our website, you consent to the use of cookies, web beacons and

               SECTION 3 - HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>
               Quantix Solutions shares your personal data with other partners, as
               described in this Policy, when services are provided by partners authorized
               by Quantix Solutions. For example, when you make an online purchase from
               Quantix Solutions, we must share your personal data with the logistics
               provider to arrange shipment or a partner to provide services. In addition,
               as a global company, we may share personal data with Quantix Solutions
               affiliates and subsidiaries.
            </p>
            <p>
               To comply with applicable laws or respond to valid legal procedures,
               Quantix Solutions may also disclose your personal data to law enforcement
               or other government agencies. If Quantix Solutions is involved in a
               restructuring, merger &amp; acquisition, or a bankruptcy or liquidation
               lawsuit in a given jurisdiction, your personal data may be disclosed in
               connection with the transaction. Quantix Solutions may also disclose your
               data when appropriate, for example, to execute Terms and Conditions, when
               we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm
               or financial loss, or when it is in connection with an investigation of
               suspected or actual illegal activity.
            </p>
            <p>
               SECTION 4 - HOW TO ACCESS &amp; CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>
               It is your responsibility to ensure that all personal data submitted to
               Quantix Solutions is correct. Quantix Solutions is dedicated to maintaining
               the accuracy and completeness of personal data and keeping the data
               up-to-date.
            </p>
            <p>
               To the extent required by applicable law, you may (i) have the right to
               access certain personal data we maintain about you, (ii) request that we
               update or correct inaccuracies in that data, (iii) object or restrict to
               our use of your personal data, and (iv) ask us to delete your personal data
               from our database. To exercise these rights, please contact us. Your
               written request may be required for security. We may decline the request if
               we have reasonable grounds to believe that the request is a fraudulent,
               unfeasible or may jeopardize the privacy of others.
            </p>
            <p>
               If allowed by applicable laws, you have the right to withdraw your consent
               at any time when Quantix Solutions processes your personal data based on
               your consent. However, withdrawal does not affect the legitimacy and
               effectiveness of how we process your personal data based on your consent
               before the withdrawal is made; nor does it affect any data processing based
               on another justification other than your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
               If you think that the way we process your personal information does not
               comply with applicable data protection laws, you can contact the relevant
               competent data protection authority. You can obtain the information for
               contacting EU data protection authorities at
               http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               SECTION 5 - HOW WE PROTECT &amp; RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>
               The security of your personal data is important to us. We use appropriate
               physical, management, and technical measures to protect your personal data
               from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss.
               For example, we use cryptographic technologies for data confidentiality,
               protection mechanisms to prevent attacks, and access control mechanisms to
               permit only authorized access to your personal data. We also provide
               training on security and privacy protection for employees to raise their
               awareness of personal data protection. Quantix Solutions is committed to
               protecting your personal data; however, please note that no security
               measure is perfect.
            </p>
            <p>
               We will retain your personal information for no longer than is necessary
               for the purposes stated in this Policy, unless otherwise extending the
               retention period is required or permitted by law. The data storage period
               may vary with scenario, product, and service. The standards Quantix
               Solutions uses to determine the retention period are as follows: the time
               required to retain personal data to fulfill business purposes, including
               providing products and services; maintaining corresponding transaction and
               business records; controlling and improving the performance and quality of
               products and services; ensuring the security of systems, products, and
               services; handling possible user queries or complaints and locating
               problems; whether the user agrees to a longer retention period; and whether
               the laws, contracts, and other equivalencies have special requirements for
               data retention; etc. We will maintain your registration information as long
               as your account is necessary for service provision. You can choose to
               deregister your account. After you deregister your account, we will stop
               providing you with products and services through your account and delete
               your relevant personal data, provided that deletion is not otherwise
               stipulated by special legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
               SECTION 6 - HOW WE PROCESS CHILDREN'S PERSONAL DATA
            </p>
            <p>
               Our websites, products and services are primarily intended for adults. A
               child must not create a Quantix Solutions account without the consent of a
               parent or guardian. If a child's personal data is collected with prior
               parental consent, we will only use or disclose the data as permitted by
               law, with the explicit consent of the child's parents or guardians, or when
               necessary for the protection of the child. If we accidentally collect a
               child's personal data without verified prior consent from the child's
               parents, we will attempt to delete the data as soon as possible.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               SECTION 7 - THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS AND THEIR SERVICES
            </p>
            <p>
               To ensure a positive user experience, you may receive content or web links
               from third parties other than Quantix Solutions and its partners ("third
               parties"). Quantix Solutions does not have the right to control such third
               parties, but you can choose whether to use the links, view the content
               and/or access the products or services provided by third parties. Quantix
               Solutions cannot control the privacy practices and data protection policies
               of third parties that are not subject to this Policy. When you submit
               personal information to such a third party, please read and refer to the
               privacy protection policy of the third party.

               Your personal data collected by Quantix Solutions may be processed or
               accessed in the country/region where you use our products and services or
               in other countries/regions where Quantix Solutions or its affiliates,
               subsidiaries, service providers or business partners have a presence. These
               jurisdictions may have different data protection laws. In such
               circumstances, Quantix Solutions will take measures to ensure that data is
               processed as required by this Policy and applicable laws, which includes
               when transferring the data subject’s personal data from the EU to a country
               or region which have been acknowledged by the EU commission as having an
               adequate level of data protection, we may use a variety of legal
               mechanisms, such as signing standard contractual clauses approved by the EU
               Commission, obtaining the consent to the cross-border transfer of a data
               subject in the EU, or implementing security measures like anonymizing
               personal data before cross-border data transfer. You can click here to
               obtain a copy of the EU’s standard contractual clauses.

               arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using
               the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the
               service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or
               omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a
               result of the use of the service or any content (or product) posted,
               transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised
               of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the
               exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
               damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to
               the maximum extent permitted by law.

               be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be
               enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the
               unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of
               Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and
               enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
            </p>
            <p>
