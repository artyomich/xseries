                        <p>X Series PRO is very easy to use once you understand the basics. Installation is
                                    achieved with an automated installer that puts everything where it
                                    needs so it just works out of the box. You can install X Series PRO in seconds to
                                    get started. We even include profiles, templates and settings so you
                                    can be up and running in no time. We also have an extensive "HELP VIDEO" section to
                                    show you the features of X Series PRO in small, digestible videos
                                    that are easy to understand. After watching the HELP VIDEOS, you should have a basic

                                    it. We are working on an extensive strategy training library that will be included
                                    with the "X Series PRO" subscriptions to show you specific
                                    strategies on how to use X Series PRO to set up profitable trades, with minimal
                                    effort. You will learn how you can minimize your time staring at
                           screens, and spend more time doing the things you enjoy.

                     <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>Neither Metatrader 4, nor X Series PRO are designed to work natively on a Mac;
                                    however, it is possible to run X Series PRO and Metatrader 4 by
                                    using a Windows emulator on a Mac [such as Metatrader for Mac]. We strongly
                                    recommend using X Series PRO on Windows PCs for best results. X Series PRO
                                    will NOT work on mobile devices such as phones or tablets as these versions of
                           Metatrader 4 do not allow complex plugins.

                     <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                        <p>Metatrader 4 is a great trading platform, but the trading process leaves much to be
                                    desired. Placing trades in MT4 is inefficient, lacks intuitive
                                    "on the charts" trading and is just plain slow. X Series PRO simplifies the trade
                                    process so you can take control of your trading. X Series PRO is
                                    powerful. It utilizes strong money management, automates position sizing
                           calculations and monitors/manages your trades so you don't have to.
